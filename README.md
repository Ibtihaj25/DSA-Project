# Huffman Encoding Challenge - Interactive Java Project
The Huffman Encoding Challenge is a Java-based GUI application designed to teach Huffman encoding and decoding, a key data compression technique. Using Java Swing, the app allows users to visualize the Huffman Tree, encode text into binary strings, and decode them back to the original form.

Predefined characters and frequencies are used to construct the tree, making it ideal for beginners to explore data structures like priority queues and binary trees interactively. The intuitive interface guides users through tree visualization, encoding, and decoding challenges, turning a complex algorithm into an engaging learning experience.

Perfect for students and enthusiasts, this project demonstrates practical applications of Huffman coding in compression systems like ZIP and MP3 files. Clone the repository, run HuffmanGameGUI.java, and dive into the world of efficient data storage.
